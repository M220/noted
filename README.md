# Noted!

A simple notes and todo app, written with Flutter. This app is written mostly with Android platform in mind as I don't have access to a Mac, and I also only use windows for testing purposes. Although the app should at least compile for other platforms as well, including Linux, Mac OS, Windows, Web and IOS.

TODO:
- ~~Change the settings page's Dropdowns to Material Alert Dialogs~~
- Add state restoration
- Add sharing functionality
- Use Navigation 2/Go Route (?)
- Complete the widget tests
- Add Undo/Redo

Design and overall suggestions are welcome!
