# Noted!

A simple notes and todo app, written with Flutter. This app is written mostly with Android platform in mind as I don't have acces to a mac, and I also only use windows for testing purposes. Although the app should at least compile for other platforms as well, including Linux, Mac OS, Windows, Web and IOS.

TODO:
- ~~Change the settings page's Dropdowns to Material Alert Dialogs~~
- Add sharing functionality
- Complete the widget tests
- Add Undo/Redo

Design and overall suggestions are welcome!

## Branch Specific

This is the base version of the app that tries to keep it simple. For example, it doesn't, and will not, support state restoration or Navigator 2/Go Route. Flutter novices can use this to see how I did the basic stuff.
