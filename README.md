# Noted!

A simple notes and todo app, written with Flutter. This app is written mostly with Android platform in mind as I don't have access to a Mac, and I also only use windows for testing purposes. Although the app should at least compile for other platforms as well, including Linux, Mac OS, Windows, Web and IOS.

TODO:
- ~~Change the settings page's Dropdowns to Material Alert Dialogs~~
- Add sharing functionality
- Complete the widget tests
- Add Undo/Redo

Design and overall suggestions are welcome!

## Branch Specific

This branch will use "Go Route" as the navigation solution for declarative navigation instead of Navigator 1's implicit one. It's basically base + Navigator 2, and so it will not support state restoration.
