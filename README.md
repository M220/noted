# Noted!

A simple notes and todo app, written with Flutter.

TODO:
- ~~Change the settings page's Dropdowns to Material Alert Dialogs~~
- Add sharing functionality
- Complete the widget tests
- Add Undo/Redo

Design and overall suggestions are welcome!

## Branch Specific

This is the base version of the app that has the base functionalities of it, while not being too complex. For example, it doesn't, and will not, support state restoration or Navigator 2/Go Route in order to stay simple. Flutter novices can use this to see how I did the basic stuff.
